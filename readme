## Challenges Faced

1. **State Management**:
   Managing the state of the cart and wishlist efficiently required setting up a Svelte store and ensuring the state was synchronized across components.

2. **Fetching Data**:
   Fetching and displaying data from the API involved handling asynchronous operations and managing loading and error states gracefully.

3. **Conditional Rendering**:
   Ensuring that descriptions and other details only appear when specific conditions are met (e.g., a product is clicked) required careful conditional rendering logic.

4. **Routing and Navigation**:
   Implementing client-side routing and navigating between different views (e.g., home, product detail) posed challenges, especially in handling state transitions and maintaining URL consistency.

5. **Styling and Responsive Design**:
   Integrating Tailwind CSS for styling and ensuring the application was responsive across different devices required adjusting the layout and styles based on different screen sizes.

## Potential Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   Improve error handling to provide more detailed feedback to users, such as network issues or server errors.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   Optimize performance by implementing lazy loading for images and components, and by reducing unnecessary re-renders.

3. **User Authentication**:
   Add user authentication and authorization to manage user-specific data such as cart items and wishlist.

4. **Testing**:
   Implement unit and integration tests to ensure the application's functionality is reliable and to catch potential bugs early.

5. **SEO and Accessibility**:
   Improve SEO and accessibility by adding meta tags, improving semantic HTML, and ensuring all interactive elements are accessible.

6. **Advanced Features**:
   Integrate more advanced features such as a recommendation system, user reviews, and a more sophisticated filtering and sorting system.
